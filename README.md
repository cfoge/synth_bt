Your HP is sacred, you shouldn’t waste it on things like multiples, attenuators and gate combiners.

Synth.BTs packs together a bunch of super handy passive synth tools into one neat kit that is as simple to build as it is useful. 

Put one of these packs in your cable bag and always be ready to solve those synth routing problems live, or in the studio.


Product Description:

Synth.BTs are a beautiful matt black PCB with gold ENIG finish. Reminiscent of a model plane kit, you build up the board, solder it and then cut out the different components to create:

2 X 4 way multiples

2 X touch pads

1 X 3.5mm to ¼’ adapter

1 X 3-in-1 out gate combiner

2 X attenuators with mute and stutter
